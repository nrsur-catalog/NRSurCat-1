# NRSurrogate Catalog

We present posterior samples associated with the paper "Analysis of GWTC-3 with fully precessing numerical relativity surrogate models", Islam et al. (2023), [arxiv.XXXX.XXX](arxiv.XXXX.XXX){cite}`catalog paper`. 
This includes 47 binary black hole gravitational wave events (from 2015-2020, LVK O1-O3) analyzed using the [NRSur7dq4] {cite}`NRSur7dq4` and [NRSur7dq4Remnant] {cite}`NRSur7dq4Remnant` models.

The posterior samples are available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/8115310) and can also be downloaded using the python-API, [nrsur_catalog](https://pypi.org/project/nrsur-catalog/).
