# NRSurrogate Catalog

We present the posterior samples of the 47 GW events (from 2015-2020, LVK O1-O3) 
with signal durations less than 64 seconds from the 
NRSurrogate Catalog {cite}`NRSurrogate_Catalog`.
The catalog fits use the [NRSur7dq4] {cite}`NRSur7dq4` surrogate model.
For details on the analysis, please refer to the [catalog paper].
